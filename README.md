# Supply-Chain-and-Logistics-Dashboard
This project was created as part of my effort to build hands-on experience in supply chain analytics and data reporting. With a strong interest in the intersection of data and operations, I wanted to simulate a real-world scenario where Excel can be used as a powerful tool to monitor supply chain performance and drive business decisions.

The goal of this project was to simulate a practical business scenario where a company needs to monitor its inventory health, evaluate supplier performance, analyze manufacturing costs, and track revenue across products and locations. I used a multi-feature dataset covering product details, stock levels, lead times, shipping costs, defect rates, and customer segments to create an end-to-end analysis tool.

Through this dashboard, I focused on five core KPIs: Total Revenue, Average Lead Time, Average Defect Rate, Total Units Sold, and Total Manufacturing Cost. I also visualized trends and comparisons through interactive charts such as Revenue by Product, Stock Levels by Product Type, Manufacturing Costs per Product, Revenue by Location, and more.

This project allowed me to practice data storytelling, improve layout design for better communication of insights, and build a tool that could support operational decision-making in a real business context. It helped me better understand how analytics contributes to improving efficiency, minimizing delays, and reducing cost leakages in the supply chain.

# 📦 Supply Chain & Logistics Dashboard (Excel)

This project is a Supply Chain & Logistics Operations Dashboard built using **Microsoft Excel**. It analyzes key operational, supplier, and inventory metrics from a simulated supply chain dataset. The dashboard is designed to provide clear visibility into inventory performance, supplier lead times, manufacturing costs, shipping logistics, and product revenue distribution.
